![account_page](/images/202501/hutao_account.webp)

The Snap Hutao Manjusaka Passport is an account system created by the DGP-Studio team for Snap Hutao Manjusaka, used to provide cloud-based services, including the Snap Hutao Manjusaka Cloud Wish Record service. You can navigate to the Snap Hutao Manjusaka Passport page by clicking the Snap Hutao Manjusaka Passport button in the left menu bar of the Snap Hutao Manjusaka client, view and manage your Snap Hutao Manjusaka Passport.

## Cloud Service Description

Cloud-related features consume a significant amount of server resources, therefore, they have time limits. Currently, Snap Hutao Manjusaka provides the following ways to enable cloud synchronization:

1.  For users who support Snap Hutao Manjusaka on AfDian, we will automatically add usage time to the Snap Hutao Manjusaka Passport that matches the AfDian email account as a token of appreciation from the Snap Hutao Manjusaka development team.
    - After payment, you should receive an email receipt. You can click the "Refresh" button on the right side of the Snap Hutao Manjusaka Passport to refresh the renewal status. Due to data synchronization delays, if the refresh fails, please wait about 5 minutes and try again.
2.  For all registered users, after each Genshin Impact account successfully uploads the Spiral Abyss challenge record to the Snap Hutao Manjusaka database for the **first time in each period**, you will get 3 days of Wish synchronization feature usage time.
    - You can use the Snap Hutao Manjusaka Cloud Wish Record service for free in the long term through this method.
3.  **Users who contribute to the Snap Hutao Manjusaka open-source community (including but not limited to code development, program design, and localization translation) can directly contact the development team to obtain a developer license or redemption code.**

## Snap Hutao Manjusaka Cloud Wish Record Service

::: warning
When your Snap Hutao Manjusaka Passport cloud synchronization permission expires, you will not be able to upload, download, or delete data, but your data will not be deleted. You can re-operate your cloud backup data after restoring your permissions.
:::

If you have Snap Hutao Manjusaka Cloud permission, you will have the following privileges:

1.  The "Prediction" feature on the Wish Record page
2.  Cloud synchronization feature of Wish records

::: info Snap Hutao Manjusaka Passport and Genshin Impact Account Relationship
Note: The relationship between Genshin Impact account data and Snap Hutao Manjusaka Passport is "**many-to-one**". That is, one Snap Hutao Manjusaka Passport can be associated with the Wish data of multiple Genshin Impact accounts, but one Genshin Impact account can only be associated with one Snap Hutao Manjusaka Passport.

If you are unable to upload wish records due to reasons such as purchasing a second-hand account, please negotiate with the previous account holder for data security reasons. Snap Hutao Manjusaka will not and cannot resolve related wish conflicts.

## Snap Hutao Manjusaka Cloud CDN Service

This feature allows users to download Snap Hutao Manjusaka updates through servers deployed in mainland China. Usually, this method can significantly improve the download speed for users in mainland China.

## Change Email/Change Password/Log Out Account/Refresh Account Status

Click the corresponding button according to your needs. Please note that after changing your password or email, you will be automatically logged into the modified account.

If you have supported Snap Hutao Manjusaka on websites like AfDian but your account status is not updated, you can click the "Refresh" button on the right side of the account to manually refresh the status. If the status is still not displayed correctly after waiting for 5 minutes and manually refreshing, please contact the developers.
