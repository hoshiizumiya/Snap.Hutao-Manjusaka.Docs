# First Developer Symposium

Copied from [GitHub Discussion Post](https://github.com/DGP-Studio/Snap.Hutao/discussions/46), summarized from group discussions

## Why is Hutao made as a UWP-like app on PC?

Developing MSIX packaged applications is a trend in desktop development, providing better development experience and improved user experience.

## What is the purpose of Hutao, and how does it differ from SG?

Hutao is the next-generation version of SG, with updates/more features/faster/stronger.

## Will Hutao fully inherit SG's features? Will some SG features be deprecated in Hutao?

Most features will be fully inherited and upgraded. Some features will appear in Hutao in an integrated form.

## Why not combine Hutao and SG together, but separate them? What are the differences in focus between them and SG?

Snap Genshin is developed using WPF technology, which is based on DirectX 9, while Hutao is developed using WinUI 3, a new technology based on DirectX 12 and other newer display technologies, providing better rendering effects and easier development. Hutao is similar to Snap Genshin but focuses on smooth and simple user experience, while also emphasizing program architecture maintainability and performance.

## Besides migrating old SG features, will there be new feature development?

As Genshin Impact develops, we will also release more features.

## Will SG never be updated again? Is SG about to become unusable?

~~Without serious data anomalies, it won't be updated anymore. Due to lack of maintenance, there is no guarantee that some functions of SG may fail at some point due to certain uncertain reasons (such as the previous sign-in function).~~
Snap.Genshin has stopped updates, the project has been archived

## Where is the usage documentation for Hutao?

~~Usage documentation @Masterain98 is in production and will be available soon.~~ This is what you are seeing now

## Will the Hutao icon be updated?

No, we hold the copyright to the Hutao icon.

## When will it be on Microsoft Store? Does being on Microsoft Store mean no need to trust certificates? Will Hutao support online updates in the future?

It will be listed after all features are perfected. No certificate needed. After listing, online updates will be supported.

## Are you considering adding a feature to calculate damage based on character panel display? When can Hutao act as a launcher to unlock frame rate? Will the borderless fullscreen feature be supported in the future?
